# Sample Test Case: Address Verification Script

## Title
Verify that the address verification script correctly identifies existing addresses using Serper API

## Preconditions
- Python 3.x is installed
- `requests` library is installed (`pip install requests`)
- Valid Serper API key is configured in the script
- Input CSV file `limited_detail_comps_5_2_2025.csv` exists in the same directory
- CSV file contains address data in columns 2, 3, 4, 5 (address, city, state, zip)

## Steps
1. Open terminal and navigate to the script directory
2. Run the command: `/usr/bin/python3 process_addresses.py`
3. Wait for script execution to complete
4. Check the generated `categorized_addresses.csv` file
5. Review the `address_processing.log` file

## Expected Result
- Script processes the first 5 rows of the CSV file
- Each row in the output CSV contains all original data plus a "Found" column
- "Found" column shows `True` for addresses that exist in Google Places
- "Found" column shows `False` for addresses that don't exist
- Log file contains detailed execution information
- No error messages are displayed in terminal output
