## Next Session To-Do List

### High Priority Tasks
1. **Implement MCP from QA Core to this project**
   - Integrate Model Context Protocol functionality
   - Ensure proper data flow and communication

2. **Jira Integration Validation**
   - Check if Jira integration can handle labels properly
   - Verify label creation, assignment, and management capabilities

3. **Jira Ticket Creation Logic Review**
   - Audit the logic for Jira ticket creation
   - Ensure all required actions can be performed
   - Test ticket creation workflow end-to-end

4. **Jira Data Reading Capabilities Assessment**
   - Evaluate how well the assistant can read all data in Jira
   - Test integration depth: labels, linked tickets, PRs, etc.
   - Assess data retrieval performance and accuracy

### Traceability System Tasks
5. **Execute Test Cases and Update Traceability**
   - Execute all frontend test cases (TC-001 through TC-061)
   - Create bug reports for any failures found
   - Update traceability matrix with test execution results
   - Track coverage gaps and missing test scenarios

### Test Execution Tasks
6. **Begin Test Execution**
   - Set up test environment using provided documentation
   - Populate test data according to specifications
   - Execute critical test scenarios first (Chrome as primary browser)
   - Execute optional cross-browser and device tests if time permits
   - Document results and create bug reports
