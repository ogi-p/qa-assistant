# Bug Report Template (Following Company Standards)

## 🆕 UPDATED: JIRA Field Mapping - Company Standards
When creating this bug in JIRA, use the following field mappings based on company Confluence template:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "project": {"key": "AP"},
    "issuetype": {"name": "Bug"},
    "summary": "[Feature / Functionality Name] Title",
    "description": "[See detailed description sections below]",
    "customfield_11332": {"value": "[Environment]"},
    "customfield_11207": {"accountId": "[QA_ASSIGNEE_ACCOUNT_ID]"},
    "assignee": {"accountId": "[ASSIGNEE_ACCOUNT_ID]"},
    "reporter": {"accountId": "[REPORTER_ACCOUNT_ID]"},
    "priority": {"name": "Normal"},
    "customfield_11311": {"value": "[Severity]"},
    "labels": ["[team_label_if_known]"],
    "customfield_11287": {"value": "[Engineering Team]"},
    "customfield_11330": [{"value": "[Stack1]"}, {"value": "[Stack2]"}]
  }
}
```

**Note**: Replace `[QA_ASSIGNEE_ACCOUNT_ID]` with the actual JIRA account ID of the QA assignee. The QA Assignee field ID is `customfield_11207` for single user assignment.
